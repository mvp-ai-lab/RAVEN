"""Expose Qwen3-VL as what MiniMax-H3 actually needs: one hidden layer.

The released pipeline conditions the DiT on an intermediate decoder layer of
Qwen3-VL, not on the head's logits. The HuggingFace class cannot hand that over:
``Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration.forward`` returns only loss, logits,
past_key_values and rope_deltas, and ``output_hidden_states=True`` is swallowed
by its ``**kwargs``, so ``.hidden_states`` is always None. The layer output has
to be taken where it is produced.

Wrapping that here rather than at the call site keeps the depth with the weights
it indexes into: ``hidden_layer`` is only meaningful against this checkpoint's
layer count, and the assertion that bounds it can only be written where the
layers exist.

    The counterpart to ``from_pretrained`` for the 1x-memory route.
    ``from_pretrained`` fuses construction with materialization, which forces the
    weights to arrive before FSDP has sharded anything -- so every rank reads a
    slice of every tensor out of the same files through mmap page faults. Under
    this route the shells stay on meta until ``fully_shard`` has decided who owns
    what, and a DCP load then streams each rank its own chunk.

    A plain callable rather than a classmethod because that is all
    ``DefaultModelInstantiate`` needs: it resolves ``class_name`` with ``getattr``
    and calls it inside ``init_empty_weights``. The path travels in ``args``, the
    same convention ``FromPretrainedInstantiate`` uses, so the weights stage sees
    a completed construction and naturally no-ops.

    ``num_hidden_layers`` is narrowed here rather than left to ``__init__``'s
    ``del``: the released directory declares 64 and H3 reads 50, and building the
    other 14 only to drop them is 14/64 of a 32 B decoder. Under the old route
    their weights were read off disk first as well. The ``del`` downstream then
    finds nothing to remove, and the bound assertion still holds at 50 <= 50.
