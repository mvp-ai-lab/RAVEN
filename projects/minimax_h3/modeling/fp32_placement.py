"""Keep MiniMax-H3's fp32 boundary modules computing in fp32 under FSDP.

The released checkpoint is 99.948% bf16 (33.106 B) and 0.052% fp32 (17.2 M).
The fp32 part is not scattered: it is six modules at the edges of the network --
the two patch projections, the two time-embedder linears, and the two output
heads -- and the model casts the ACTIVATION to match at each of them
(``_embed`` -> fp32 rows, ``time_embedder`` -> fp32 sinusoid, ``final_layer``
-> ``h.to(fp32)``). Weight and activation are fp32 together there and bf16
together everywhere else, which is why the released model needs no autocast.

FSDP breaks that pairing from one side only. ``MixedPrecisionPolicy`` is
constructed once in common/model/placement.py and handed to every
``fully_shard`` call, so ``param_dtype: bfloat16`` all-gathers those six
modules' weights as bf16 while the model keeps casting their inputs to fp32 --
and ``_Linear.forward`` is a bare ``F.linear``, which raises rather than
promoting. Going the other way (``param_dtype: null`` with fp32 masters) fails
symmetrically in the 50-block trunk.

This plugin shards those six modules FIRST, each with its own fp32 policy.
``_get_managed_modules`` stops its DFS at any submodule that already carries an
FSDP state, so the wrap units and the root that placement shards afterwards
never reclaim them, and each unit keeps the policy it was created with. The
result is what the config alone cannot express: fp32 master weights everywhere
(``weight_dtype: float32``), compute dtype following the source annotation.

Config::

    placement:
      weight_dtype: float32
      plugins:
        - module: projects.minimax_h3.modeling.fp32_placement
          class_name: MiniMaxH3FP32ModulePlacement
      fsdp:
        wrap_modules: [CausalMiniMaxH3DiTBlock]
        param_dtype: bfloat16      # everything this plugin did not claim
        reduce_dtype: float32
        cpu_offload: true

The plugin takes no config of its own: the module set comes from the model and
every FSDP setting is read back from ``placement.fsdp`` so the two cannot drift.
