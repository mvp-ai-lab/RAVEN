"""Weight loader for the released MiniMax-H3 DiT checkpoint.

Not vendored code -- this file is ours.

The released checkpoint stores every ``*.attn.qkv_proj.weight`` in the layout
MiniMax trained with: rows grouped **per head** as ``[q0, k0, v0, q1, k1, v1,
...]``. The model expects the layout SGLang runs with: three contiguous blocks
``[q_all, k_all, v_all]``. Both have identical shape and identical value
multisets -- only the row permutation differs -- so a state dict alone carries
no evidence of which layout it is in.

Upstream resolves this with a ``weight_loader`` closure installed on the qkv
parameter (``MiniMaxH3Attention._install_qkv_weight_loader``), which sglang's
own loader routes through. This repo does not: ``DefaultWeightLoader`` calls
``model.load_state_dict`` directly, which bypasses ``weight_loader`` entirely
and would load qkv in the wrong row order -- silently, since the shapes match.

Doing the permutation inside ``MiniMaxH3DiTModel.load_state_dict`` instead would
be wrong, because the permutation is not idempotent: training checkpoints are
saved in runtime layout, so resuming would permute an already-permuted tensor
and scramble it, again silently.

So the permutation belongs to the *path* that loads the released checkpoint, and
nowhere else. ``_remap_keys`` is the hook the repo already designates for that
(cf. ``TransformersWeightLoader``): it runs only for an explicit ``weight.path``
load, never for checkpointer/DCP resume. Which layout is being loaded is then a
property of the configured loader rather than something guessed at runtime.

The ``dit.`` prefix is the same kind of property. A model node is a
``MiniMaxH3X0Model`` holding the DiT at ``.dit``, so its state dict is ``dit.*``
while the released file -- a dump of the DiT alone -- carries no prefix. Adding
it here rather than delegating ``load_state_dict`` on the wrapper keeps one
namespace everywhere else, including DCP, which addresses state-dict keys as
paths into the module tree.

This loader therefore reads exactly one thing: the RELEASED checkpoint.

  * Released weights -> here. Unprefixed keys in per-head qkv layout.
  * Our own checkpoints, resumed -> DCP, which never touches this file. It saves
    and loads through the module tree's own names, so it is symmetric by
    construction and needs no translation.
  * Our own checkpoints, re-loaded through ``weight.path`` to seed a new trial ->
    ``DefaultWeightLoader``. ``export_state`` writes ``dit.*`` with the LoRA
    already folded in and qkv already in runtime layout, so there is nothing left
    to translate; running them through this loader would prefix them twice and
    permute qkv a second time, and the permutation is not idempotent. Misrouting
    it is not silent -- the doubly-prefixed qkv keys match no attention module,
    which is what the assertion in ``_remap_keys`` refuses.

Usage -- in the trial YAML, on the model node that reads the released weights::

    weight:
      module: projects.minimax_h3.modeling.weights
      class_name: MiniMaxH3WeightLoader
      path: /root/models/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA/transformer/model.safetensors.index.json
