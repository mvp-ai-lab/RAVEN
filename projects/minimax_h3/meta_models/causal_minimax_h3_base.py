"""CausalMiniMaxH3Base: the chunk-causal MiniMax-H3 T2AV mechanism, and its validation.

Everything a chunk-causal MiniMax-H3 student needs in order to *run*: derive the
packed layout from a dataset batch, pack rows for the causal ABI and for the
native bidirectional one, drive the KV-cached chunk-by-chunk rollout, decode a
clip through both VAEs and log it, and reduce a per-modality loss. No training
algorithm is attached -- those live in the subclasses (DMD in
``causal_minimax_h3_dmd.py``, and DMD2/TF/TSCD on top of it), while
``minimax_h3_base.py`` is the bidirectional counterpart. The class is concrete,
so a validation-only trial names it directly and carries no training knobs:
``config.diffusion`` supplies the four components validation needs
(``sampling_timesteps`` and ``audio_sampling_timesteps``, same step count with
their own shifts, plus ``schedule`` and ``sampler``), and ``models`` must provide
``backbone`` and ``text_encoder``, plus ``video_vae``/``audio_vae`` once
validation is enabled (and ``backbone_ema`` when ``validation.validate_ema``).
The layout authority is ``projects/minimax_h3/data/causal_text_only.py`` for the
causal packed layout and ``projects/minimax_h3/modeling/packing.py`` for the
native bidirectional one, so this file derives, never re-invents.

Four H3 contracts drive the code below. (1) **No CFG** -- the released checkpoint
is guidance-distilled: one positive pass, no negative prompt, no guidance scale.
(2) **The repo timestep convention never leaves this file.** ``0`` means clean,
exactly; noisy rows carry the repo sigma, and ``MiniMaxH3X0Model`` owns the
translation to H3's inverted ``t_h3 = 1 - t_repo``, the per-modality clean
constant and the velocity sign. Context rows must therefore be written as a
literal ``0.0`` (the wrapper's mask is an exact equality test) and full-shape
``eps``/``audio_eps`` must be passed so the wrapper can apply the clean
augmentation ``0.999*x0 + 0.001*eps``. (3) **Video and audio share a step index
but not a timestep**, so rollout drives the two shifted grids in lockstep and
asserts they have the same length. (4) **Audio is a small fraction of the packed
elements**, so each modality is reduced against its own element count and the two
are combined with ``audio_loss_weight`` (default 1.0 == equal weight) rather than
against one joint count.

Rollout shape: the cache's chunk boundaries must line up with the training mask's
non-noise splits, and split 0 is the text, so the text gets its own cache-fill
forward (folding it into the first media chunk would let text rows attend media
rows and poison the cached text keys) and each media chunk is then
``denoise (cache read-only) -> cache-fill on the student's own detached x0``. The
clean ``eps`` rows are drawn once per rollout and carried on ``_RolloutX0s`` so a
later teacher-forced forward can reuse the exact rows the cache-fill saw. The
dataset owns tokenization and ships ``text_input_ids``/``text_lens``; the text
encoder is called **once per batch** as
``text_encoder(input_ids=[B, L], attention_mask=[B, L]) -> [B, L, D]`` and **must
honour the mask**, since rows are right-padded to the longest prompt and sliced
back by ``text_lens`` -- one call per batch also keeps the collective count from
becoming rank-dependent. Sequence parallelism is supported on every path: every
packed sequence is padded to a multiple of the Ulysses world size, and the
padding always travels as its own attention document and its own zero-retention
cache sample, so it is invisible to every real sample.
