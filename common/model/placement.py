"""Model placement stage: how the model lands on hardware.

A single default implementation covers both answers to that question: plain
``.to(device)`` when no ``fsdp`` node is configured (``device`` defaults to
``cuda``), ``fully_shard`` across the default device mesh when it is. The EMA
model, when present, is placed identically by the entry (placement classes face
a single model, like every other stage).

Placement always runs: an omitted ``placement`` node is treated exactly like
``placement: {}``, so a built model is never silently left on CPU/meta -- it
lands on cuda by default. Opt out of the device move only by configuring it
(``placement.device: cpu``).

Like runtime, placement supports before/after plugins (subclasses of
``PlacementPlugin``), routed on ``module`` / ``class_name`` under a ``plugins``
list and run on the main model and the EMA. ``before_placement`` runs before the
core class, ``after_placement`` after it. This is where from-scratch
materialization lives (there is no meta guard: a model that reaches placement on
meta without a plugin to materialize it will fail loud on torch's own error --
the user's risk to take). A meta model is materialized + initialized by an init
plugin at the point dictated by the path: non-fsdp before ``.to()`` (``.to``
cannot move a meta tensor), fsdp after ``fully_shard`` (which shards meta tensors
natively, then ``to_empty`` materializes each rank's shard).

    # (no placement node)            # same as placement: {} -> .to(cuda)

    placement: {}                     # .to(cuda)

    placement:
      device: cpu                     # .to(cpu)

        cpu_offload: true             # optional, offload sharded params/grads
                                      # to CPU (CPUOffloadPolicy)
        shard_size: 8                 # optional, hybrid shard: shard within
                                      # groups of this many ranks, replicate
                                      # across the world_size/shard_size groups
                                      # (typically = GPUs per node)
                                      # explicit null on either dtype = follow
                                      # the parameters' own dtype (torch raw)

``device`` and ``fsdp`` are mutually exclusive: the fsdp path derives the
device from ``LOCAL_RANK``, so a configured ``device`` would be silently
ignored.

FSDP always reshards every wrapped unit, including the root, after forward.
Placement shards one unit at a time and leaves managed parameter/buffer device
movement to ``fully_shard`` for both regular and CPU-offloaded FSDP. PyTorch may
stage each full wrap unit on the target device internally before creating its
local shard; CPU offload then moves that shard back to CPU.

``weight_dtype`` is the storage dtype of the parameters being trained (the
master weights). The cast runs on each parameter's current device before its
wrap unit is sharded. With the standard mmap+assign load path this is a per-unit
CPU cast, so only the current unit receives private target-dtype CPU storage;
the full model is never cast at once. Only trainable
floating-point parameters are cast; frozen parameters keep their file dtype
(convert those via ``weight.dtype`` or offline if needed). The EMA's mirror
parameters (those matching the main model's trainable names) are cast the same
way, so the engine's EMA update sees matching dtypes on both sides and never
rounds. This is orthogonal to ``fsdp.param_dtype``: ``weight_dtype`` governs the
sharded storage, ``param_dtype`` the transient all-gather/compute -- the
standard recipe is ``weight_dtype: float32`` with the default bf16 ``mp_policy``.
