"""Packed-sequence visibility rules and flex-attention backend dispatch.

A packed sequence is described by segment lengths, per-segment attention modes
(``causal``, ``full``, or ``noise``), a sink count, and an optional window size.
This module exposes two equivalent representations of that visibility contract:

* ``_prepare_flex_attention_mask`` returns variable-length query/key rectangles,
  attention types, and workload accounting for ``flex_flash_attn_func``. The
  optional ``kv_split_lens`` argument allows query and key segment layouts to
  differ.
* ``create_sparse_mask`` builds a torch ``BlockMask`` for
  ``torch.nn.attention.flex_attention`` while applying the compiler settings
  required to avoid materializing a dense quadratic mask.

``FlexAttention`` selects the available backend and consumes the corresponding
representation. Keeping mask construction and dispatch together ensures both
backends enforce the same visibility semantics.

    # the sequence length dynamic on the second distinct Q_LEN and from then on
    # reuses one kernel for every length. Measured on H100 over 28 consecutive
    # sequence lengths: ``dynamic=False`` compiled 28 times, automatic dynamic
    # compiled once.

    # A symbolic length is not free per kernel, and the mechanism is worth naming
    # because it is not what it looks like. The ``IS_DIVISIBLE`` template flag is
    # decided by ``seq_len_q % 128 != 0`` at
    # ``torch/nn/attention/flex_attention.py:230`` in the forward (a structural
    # sympy comparison) and by ``statically_known_true`` at ``:606-611`` in the
    # backward. Neither can prove anything about a SymInt, so as soon as the length
    # is symbolic ``IS_DIVISIBLE`` is False for EVERY shape, aligned or not, and
    # every KV block -- not just the ragged last one -- runs the
    # ``CHECK_BLOCK_BOUNDARY=True`` branch (an extra modulo plus a ``tl.where`` per
    # block). That, not the ragged tail, is where the measured 2-10% pure-forward
    # penalty comes from. It does not survive into training: fwd+bwd is 0.99x/1.00x
    # of static at 8192/16384 tokens (10 heads x 256 head_dim, bf16, packed
    # sample-isolation + causal mask), and training runs fwd+bwd. So there is
    # nothing to buy by pinning the shape.

    HOW it collapses to one: the five tables are algebraically redundant. ``split_id``
    is the segment index, and the two other per-segment tables are functions of it
    plus that segment's mode --

#
# ``has_large_inner_fn()`` is SHARED by both, so raising ``realize_opcount_threshold``
# alone closes the only branch our predicate trips.
#
# The read-count gates never fire, and the reason is easy to get wrong: for a
# Pointwise, ``num_reads()`` is ``len(inner_fn_opcount().read_buffers)``
# (torch/_inductor/ir.py:1045) -- the number of DISTINCT BUFFERS read, not the number
# of load instructions. ``table[q_idx]`` and ``table[kv_idx]`` are two loads but one
# buffer. The packed predicate reads exactly ONE, versus five for the five-table
# reference implementation it replaced, so both 4 and 8 are far away.
#
# That is measured, not argued -- a torch 2.9.1 benchmark sweep covered all
# 16 subsets of four candidate knobs and split 8:8 on the presence of this one alone,
# and a repro confirmed the three others are no-ops (an apparent 52-vs-2 MiB difference
# was allocator carryover from the preceding measurement; it vanished once the sweep
# order was rotated). ``tests/test_packed_sparse_mask.py`` does not reproduce that
# sweep -- it is the standing regression gate, measuring predicate x knob at production
# lengths.
#
# Consequence for anyone editing the packed predicate: the headroom is in buffers,
# not bits. Adding a new per-token field by opening a SEPARATE tensor walks toward the
# gates (four more such tensors re-arms gate B, eight re-arms gate A); packing it into
# the spare bits of the existing word costs nothing. Two bits are free today, and
# ``_SPLIT_BITS``/``_ID_BITS`` are 20 each against real values in the low thousands,

# Same if torch changes -- this reads two private thresholds out of ``_inductor.config``

# ``tests/test_packed_sparse_mask.py``, which fails loudly if the peak goes
# back to O(N^2).

# RE-MEASURED on torch 2.11.0+cu128 (H200) by that gate, and the pairing holds. peak
# over N^2 at N=65536: (reference, no knob) 1.0005, (reference, knob) 1.0005,
# (packed, no knob) 1.0151, (packed, knob) 0.0016 -- 4098 MiB down to 6.52 MiB, 629x,
# consistent with the 679x result on 2.9.1. NEITHER HALF WORKS ALONE, and
# packed-without-knob is in fact slightly WORSE than the reference (316 vs 256 MiB
# at N=16384): the saving is
# in buffer count, so when fusion does not happen the int64 table is just one more
# intermediate. ``realize_opcount_threshold`` still exists on 2.11, default still 30.
# The (packed, knob) cell measures ``create_sparse_mask`` whole, so unlike the other
# three it carries its own int64 table (512 KiB at N=65536) inside the measured window
# -- that is the entire difference between 629x here and the 681x an earlier shape
# reported, not a regression.
